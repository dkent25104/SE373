    <h1>This is the index for Lab 2</h1>
    <p>
        As long as you have fun and learn from it, nothing is wasted. Just sorta work it around and around here. It's very easy to make a sky darker, but it's a son of a gun to make it lighter. Don't worry about it; have fun with it! Let's have some big, fluffy clouds in this painting. Don't just cover it all up -- leave these spots! Drop in a happy little sky here. We don't want to overload it, just a little bit.
